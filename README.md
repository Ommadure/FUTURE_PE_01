# AI-Generated YouTube Video Project 🎬🤖

## 📌 Overview

This repository documents my first completed task as a **Prompt Engineering Intern** at **Future Intern**. The goal of the project was to **create a YouTube video entirely using AI tools**, showcasing creativity, automation, and prompt engineering skills.

## 🧠 Objective

Leverage AI platforms to:
- Research and identify a high-engagement topic
- Generate a script and screenplay
- Produce a video using AI tools
- Design a custom thumbnail with AI

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** – for topic research, scriptwriting, and screenplay generation
- **InVideo.io** – to transform the script into a 3-minute 37-second AI-generated video
- **Fliki.ai** – to create a custom AI-generated video thumbnail

## 🔍 Process

1. **Topic Research & Ideation**
   - Used ChatGPT to explore trending and high-engagement topics relevant to YouTube audiences.
2. **Script & Screenplay Generation**
   - Prompted ChatGPT to generate a full script with clear scene directions and narration structure.
3. **Video Production**
   - Uploaded the script to InVideo.io and utilized AI video templates, voiceovers, and visuals to assemble the video.
4. **Thumbnail Creation**
   - Designed a professional and appealing thumbnail using Fliki.ai's generative capabilities.

## ✅ Key Skills Demonstrated

- Prompt engineering & iteration
- Creative storytelling using AI
- AI-based video production workflows
